# Lan-Way Roofing

## Introduction

The application encompasses front-end and back-end development to provide a complete and functional web application for customers and employees to interact. The website provides utilities that handle quote requests and functions that allow administrators to update dynamic content on the webpage, and more. The user interface is designed based on input from company employeesâ€™ prior experience with the legacy website. The goal of the front-end development is to have a professional and aesthetic user interface where customers can learn more about the company's history, mission, roofing techniques, and see featured projects. Back-end development includes a database that stores employee and customer information and operations that implement the application's functional requirements. The website was developed with security, scalability, and performance in mind. This is an azure cloud solution with all the benefits of the cloud such as laaS, PaaS, etc.
